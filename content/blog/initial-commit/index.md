So I made this github hosted and netlifycms managed gatsby-site for testing purposes and to documentate some of the
things I work on on my spare time.

I like how easy this was to setup. The default gatsby theme is fully customizable 
and adding new content is really easy, just git push new content to github and netlifycms build system starts building/publishing
the changes.

I used to have a website running on wordpress.com, got bored of it due to lack of customizability and moved to self hosted 
wordpress.org, didn't like that either and now I'm trying this stack.
